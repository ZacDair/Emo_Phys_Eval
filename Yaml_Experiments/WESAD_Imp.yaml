# Example YAML file for loading raw data, windowing, labelling windows, extracting features


# Load data from dataset files
dataloading:
  dataset: WESAD # WESAD or CASE, dataset name corresponding to data loading code found in Modules_old/dataloading.py

  sample rates: # numerical value in Hz
    ecg: 700
    ppg: 64
    label: 700

  method: features # or features or windows (if raw or windows a subsequent feature extraction stage is required)

  data location: Data/Saves/WESAD/

  output location: Data/Saves/WESAD/res


# Split data into windows of size x and label
windowing:
  window size: 10 # numerical value in seconds

  labelling:
    method: mean # TODO: add mode, etc
    conversion: null # or categorical for CASE

  drop labels: [0, 5, 6, 7] # WESAD 0, 5, 6, 7
  # TODO: add adjacent data handling


# Conduct noise reduction on whole signal, or windows
noise reduction:
  enabled: yes # or no

  method:
    signal size: window # or window (full runs noise reduction on whole signal prior to windowing, otherwise conducts on windows)
    name: heartpy_basic
    min cutoff: 0.5
    max cutoff: 2.5
    filter type: bandpass

# Conducted by default if dataloading method is raw or windows
feature extraction:
  method: heartpy # or neurokit - to be implemented
  features: all # or [key1, key2]


# Experiments to be conducted
experiments:

#  # Default setup for feature difference - conducted during windowing
#  feature difference:
#    data: both # ecg, ppg or both
#    feature keys : [ibi, breathingrate, bpm] # or all
#    labels: [1, 2, 3, 4] # or [label_1, label_2, ...] of the labels we care about
#    subjects: all # or [sub_1, sub_2, ...] of the subjects we care about
#    plot: yes
#    save location: Results/ # or null for no saving

  # Default setup for feature importance - if no model provided - runs model selection to identify best model
  feature importance:
    data: both # ecg, ppg or both
