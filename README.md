# Variance and Performance of ECG and PPG Signals in Classifying Affective State

Second version of the physiological signal evaluation platform.
Now includes automated experiment running from YAML configurations.

## Provided Functions
- Automated/Compartmentalised experiment running via YAML files
- ECG and PPG Feature Extraction - leveraging HeartPy
- ECG and PPG Windowing and labelling in accordance with dataset author instructions
- Cardiac feature difference analysis between ECG and PPG of the same dataset
- Cardiac feature importance from emotive ECG and PPG, using SHAP and a selected Machine Learning classifier
- Model selection including cross-validation (several base Sklearn models supported)

## Instructions
1. Download the supported datasets, unzip and place in the Data/Datasets directory
2. Ensure a correct installation of python is available
3. Load the datasets, window the signals, extract features and label accordingly using CASE_Features.py and WESAD_Features.py respectively
4. ML Operations including model selection, feature importance, and plotting ROC curves is handled in ML.py
5. Feature difference analysis is provided by Signal_Wide_Stats.py


## Supported Datasets
CASE - [The Continuously Annotated Signals of Emotion (CASE) dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0209-0)  
WESAD - [WESAD (Wearable Stress and Affect Detection) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/WESAD)

**_Note:_** _Datasets following the same structure as the above may also be supported._

 _The expected structure is a Root directory containing subdirectories per participant, which in turn include either individual files for ECG, PPG and Labels as in CASE, or a combined file as in WESAD
 Reading from .pkl and .csv supported._

Runtime configurations are located in Configs.config.py - these include HeartPy feature names, Dictionary of Sklearn models, YAML Experiment directory

Main.py acts as the entry point, which runs all experiments located in the YAML Experiment directory one by one.
